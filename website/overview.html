        Overview:
        For our project we chose to create a recipe storing and sorting application called Recipe Buddy. Each user will have their own profile and be able to add and edit recipes on that profile.
        As they add recipes they should be able to rate the recipe based on how they feel it turned out. They should also be able to add a list of ingredients, equipment needed, a cooking and prep time, an image of the meal,
        and any instructions on how to cook each recipe. The user may also create tags or folders of their own to sort their recipes. After creating the recipes the user will have the ability to sort through 
        their recipes by cook time, ingredients, allergies, equipment needed, price, or rating. If the user feels they no longer need a recipe they should be able to delete the recipe. The stretch goal for this project
        is to have it be a sort of social media for recipes as users would be able to share their recipes with each other.
